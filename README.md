# Terraform Toolkit

## Welcome to the Terraform Toolkit

The **Terraform Toolkit** is a cutting-edge platform for envisioning the future of human survival on Mars. This project bridges the realms of data analysis, artificial intelligence, and creative speculation to offer insights into the challenges and possibilities of life on the Red Planet.

Simply input a mission date, and the system will:

1. Analyze Mars' environment based on imagery captured by the NASA Mars Rover.
2. Generate a detailed description of the terrain and atmospheric conditions.
3. Propose an innovative survival solution tailored to the specific challenges observed in the Mars Rover images.

------

## Features

- **NASA Mars Rover Integration**
   Uses the NASA API to fetch images of Mars for a specified Earth date.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**
   Employs GPT-4 and DALL-E to generate detailed terrain descriptions and visualize speculative survival tools.
- **Custom Visualization**
   Converts descriptive insights into unique, futuristic concepts through DALL-E's image generation capabilities.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ollyje/MarsRover_GPT
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd terraform-toolkit
   ```

3. Set up a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

4. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Add API keys:

   - Create a `nasakey.txt` file and add your NASA API key.
   - Set environment variables for Azure OpenAI:
     - `AZURE_KEY`
     - `AZURE_ENDPOINT`

6. Run the application:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

------

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser:

   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

2. Enter a mission date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

3. Submit the date to:

   - Fetch the corresponding Mars Rover image.
   - Generate a descriptive analysis and speculative survival solution.
   - View both the original image and the speculative visual generated by DALL-E.

------

## File Structure

- **`app.py`**
   Main Flask application handling routes and logic.
- **`rovergpt.py`**
   Contains helper functions for NASA API integration, AI image generation, and GPT-based analysis.
- **`templates/`**
   HTML templates for the application interface.
- **`static/`**
   Directory for storing images and generated outputs.

------

## Future Enhancements

- Integration of other planetary datasets for a broader scope.
- Additional customization options for speculative tool generation.
- Improved image rendering for enhanced user experience.
